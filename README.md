# ScrapeCity
Webscraping Apartments.com for price modeling.

## Objective
This is a development space for a webscraping application for Apartments.com. The primary objective is to 
extract relevant criteria for apartments in a specified area. This data will be stored in a sqlite database. 
Later, this information can be used for price modeling for specific cities/urban areas. 

## Future Work
* Explore price modeling methods.
* Include more data, specifically building metadata.
* Expand search to different urban areas - let the user choose any search criteria desired.

## Built With
* [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) - Library for extracting data from HTML
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) - HTTP Requests library
* [RegEx](https://www.regular-expressions.info/) - Character sequence searching
